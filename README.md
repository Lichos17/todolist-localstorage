# General Info

This is a project to simulate a To Do List where you can add you daily activities and remove it. These activities will be located at local 
storage, so you'll be able to refresh and still have your activities. Nevertheless, there are some issues at the local storage that you may see,
mainly in the array that is full of null because I tried to use different ways to delete the activitie when a checkbox gets checked and the HTML
works, but the local storage does not. This is a problem when you refresh the window because you may notice that the activitie that you deleted
is still there but another activitie is not. This is how it works
